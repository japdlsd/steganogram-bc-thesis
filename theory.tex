\chapter{Theoretical aspects of application}

In this chapter we will talk about steganographic communication protocol,
discuss various possible communication channels (carriers), describe
used algorithms (both for steganography and cryptography) with concrete
settings. Then we will talk about limits of algorithms we've chosen and
how to maximize their strength by follow "good policies" of usage.
